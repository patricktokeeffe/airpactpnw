# AIRPACT, on Twitter

This project assembles daily [AIRPACT-5 imagery](http://lar.wsu.edu/airpact/graphics.html) 
into animated GIFs and posts them on Twitter under the handle [@airpactpnw](https://twitter.com/airpactpnw).
As the project [homepage](http://lar.wsu.edu/airpact/index.html) explains:

> The goal of the AIRPACT (Air Indicator Report for Public Awareness and 
> Community Tracking) project is to provide timely air quality (AQ) information 
> to people in the Pacific Northwest region.

The goal of this project is to expand the AIRPACT audience and to make its imagery
data easier to share.
